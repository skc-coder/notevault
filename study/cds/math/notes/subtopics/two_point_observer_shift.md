# Two-Point Observer Shift & Shadow Length Problems

## Theory & Intuitive Foundations

When an observer moves a distance $d$ along a horizontal line directly towards or away from a vertical tower of height $h$:
- As the observer moves **towards** the tower, the angle of elevation **increases** ($\alpha \to \beta$ where $\beta > \alpha$).
- As the observer moves **away** from the tower (or shadow lengthens), the angle of elevation **decreases**.

### Derivation of Shift Equation

Let the initial distance from the tower base be $x_1$ and final distance be $x_2$:
- $x_1 = h \cot \alpha$
- $x_2 = h \cot \beta$
- The distance moved $d = x_1 - x_2$:
  $$d = h(\cot \alpha - \cot \beta)$$
- Solving for $h$:
  $$h = \frac{d}{\cot \alpha - \cot \beta} = \frac{d \sin \alpha \sin \beta}{\sin(\beta - \alpha)}$$
