# Euclidean Division Algorithm for Polynomials

## Core Concept & Theory

When polynomials cannot be easily factorized using standard quadratic/cubic grouping techniques, the **Euclidean Long Division Algorithm** is used to find their HCF.

Given two polynomials $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ with $\operatorname{deg}(P) \ge \operatorname{deg}(Q)$:
1. **Division Step**: Divide $P(x)$ by $Q(x)$ to get quotient $q_1(x)$ and remainder $R_1(x)$:
   $$P(x) = Q(x) \cdot q_1(x) + R_1(x), \quad \operatorname{deg}(R_1) < \operatorname{deg}(Q)$$
2. **Successive Division**: If $R_1(x) \neq 0$, make $Q(x)$ the new dividend and $R_1(x)$ the new divisor:
   $$Q(x) = R_1(x) \cdot q_2(x) + R_2(x)$$
3. **Termination**: Repeat until the remainder becomes zero: $R_{k-1}(x) = R_k(x) \cdot q_{k+1}(x) + 0$.
4. **Result**: The non-zero remainder $R_k(x)$ prior to zero remainder (monic or multiplied by scalar common factor) is the $\operatorname{HCF}(P(x), Q(x))$.

## Critical Rules for Polynomial Division:

1. **Stage 1 Pre-Extraction Rule (Mandatory)**:
   Before starting long division, **always factor out all shared monomial terms ($x^k$) and scalar constants** common to BOTH original polynomials $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$. Save this outer HCF to multiply back at the very end.

2. **Intermediate Variable Factor Rule**:
   If a variable factor $x^k$ appears inside a remainder at an intermediate division step:
   - **THROW IT AWAY (DISCARD IT)**!
   - **Why?** Since you already extracted all common $x^k$ factors in Stage 1, the inner polynomials have no common $x$ factor. Any $x^k$ appearing in an intermediate remainder is an unshared artifact of polynomial division (i.e. $x=0$ is NOT a root of both polynomials). Discard $x^k$ to keep the degree minimal!

3. **Numerical Scalar Extraction**:
   If a constant scalar factor exists in an intermediate remainder (e.g. $-39$ or $11$), **discard it** to prevent fractional algebra.

4. **Negative Leading Coefficient**:
   If the leading term of a remainder is negative, multiply by $-1$ before making it the next divisor.

## Direct Proof / Intuition

Why does $\operatorname{gcd}(P, Q) = \operatorname{gcd}(Q, R)$?
If $D(x)$ divides both $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$, then $D(x)$ divides $P(x) - Q(x)q(x) = R(x)$.
Conversely, if $D(x)$ divides $Q(x)$ and $R(x)$, it must divide $Q(x)q(x) + R(x) = P(x)$.
Thus, the set of common divisors of $(P, Q)$ is identical to $(Q, R)$, proving $\operatorname{HCF}(P, Q) = \operatorname{HCF}(Q, R)$.
