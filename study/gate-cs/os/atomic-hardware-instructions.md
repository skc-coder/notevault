Modern computer architectures provide special hardware instructions that execute read-modify-write cycles **atomically** (i.e., as a single, uninterruptible unit of computation at the hardware bus/cache level).

>        *target = true;
>        return rv;

>    *Sets the memory location to `true` and returns its old value atomically.*

>    int fetch_and_add(int *target, int val) {
>        int old = *target;
>        *target += val;
>        return old;
>    }
>    ```
>    *Increments the value at target memory location by `val` and returns the previous value atomically.*

> 3. **Compare-and-Swap (`CAS` / `compare_and_swap`):**
>    ```c
>    bool compare_and_swap(int *ptr, int expected, int new_val) {
>        if (*ptr == expected) {
>            *ptr = new_val;
>            return true;
>        }
>        return false;
>    }
>    ```
>    *Checks if `*ptr == expected`; if equal, updates `*ptr` to `new_val` and returns `true`. Otherwise, returns `false` without modifying memory.*


**However, there are some serious disadvantages:**
* Busy waiting is employed: Thus, while a process is waiting for access to a critical
section, it continues to consume processor time.
* Starvation is possible: When a process leaves a critical section and more than
one process is waiting, the selection of a waiting process is arbitrary. Thus, some
process could indefinitely be denied access.

PROPERTIES OF THE MACHINE-INSTRUCTION APPROACH The use of a special machine
instruction to enforce mutual exclusion has a number of advantages:
* Itis applicable to any number of processes on either a single processor or mul-
tiple processors sharing main memory.
¢ Itis simple and therefore easy to verify.
¢ It can be used to support multiple critical sections; each critical section can be
defined by its own variable.
