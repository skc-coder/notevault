## Abstract Data Types (ADTs) vs. DSA

An **Abstract Data Type (ADT)** defines *what* operations can be performed on data, without specifying *how* they are implemented—focusing on behavior and interface. A **data structure** is the concrete implementation of an ADT, detailing how data is organized and manipulated in memory.

For example, a **Stack ADT** defines operations like `push` and `pop`, but it can be implemented using an array (Array-based Stack) or a linked list (Linked Stack).

### 1. Common ADTs and Their Implementations

#### List ADT
Represents an ordered sequence of elements with operations like `get(pos)`, `add(pos, item)`, and `remove(pos)`.

- **Array-based implementation**: Fast access (`O(1)`), but insertion/deletion costly (`O(n)`).
- **Linked List implementation**: Dynamic size, efficient insertions/deletions at ends (`O(1)`), but slow access (`O(n)`).

#### Stack ADT
Follows Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle with `push`, `pop`, and `peek` operations.

- **Array-based Stack**: Fixed or dynamic size; efficient time complexity.
- **Linked List-based Stack**: Grows dynamically; no risk of overflow.

#### Queue ADT
Follows First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle with `enqueue` and `dequeue` operations.

- **Array-based Queue**: Can use circular buffer for efficiency.
- **Linked List-based Queue**: Efficient insertion and deletion from front and rear.

#### Deque (Double-ended Queue) ADT
Allows insertion and removal from both ends.

- **Array-based Deque**: Efficient if using dynamic array with amortized resizing.
- **Doubly Linked List**: Natural fit due to bidirectional links.

#### Set ADT
Stores unique elements with operations like `insert`, `delete`, and `contains`.

- **Hash Table**: Average `O(1)` for operations.
- **Balanced BST (e.g., Red-Black Tree)**: Guaranteed `O(log n)` performance.

#### Map (Associative Array) ADT
Stores key-value pairs with operations like `put(key, value)` and `get(key)`.

- **Hash Table**: Fast average-case lookup.
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: Ordered keys, `O(log n)` with balanced trees.

#### Priority Queue ADT
Retrieves elements based on priority (highest/lowest first).

- **Heap (Binary/Multiway)**: Most common; supports `insert` and `extract-max/min` in `O(log n)`.
- **Sorted Array/List**: Simple but inefficient for dynamic data.
