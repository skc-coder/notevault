# HCF Models & Co-Prime Pair Counting

## Theory & Calculation Methods

### 1. Long Division Method (Euclidean Algorithm)
To find $\operatorname{HCF}(a, b)$ where $a > b$:
1. Divide the larger number ($a$) by the smaller number ($b$) to get remainder $r_1$.
2. Divide the previous divisor ($b$) by the remainder ($r_1$) to get remainder $r_2$.
3. Repeat this process: **Divide the previous divisor by the new remainder**.
4. Stop when the remainder becomes $0$. The **last divisor used** is the HCF of the two numbers.

#### Extension to 3 Numbers:
To find $\operatorname{HCF}(A, B, C)$:
$$\operatorname{HCF}(A, B, C) = \operatorname{HCF}\Big(\operatorname{HCF}(A, B), C\Big)$$
- **Step 1**: Find $H_1 = \operatorname{HCF}(A, B)$ using division method.
- **Step 2**: Find $\operatorname{HCF}(H_1, C)$ using division method. The resulting final divisor is the HCF of all 3 numbers.

#### Proof of Euclidean Algorithm:
If $a = b \cdot q + r$, then any common divisor of $a$ and $b$ must also divide $r = a - b \cdot q$.
Conversely, any common divisor of $b$ and $r$ must divide $a = b \cdot q + r$.
Hence, $\operatorname{GCD}(a, b) = \operatorname{GCD}(b, r)$.

### 3. Core HCF Remainder Rules & Theorems


#### Rule 2: Greatest Divisor Leaving Specified Remainders $(a, b, c)$
The greatest number that divides $x, y, z$ leaving remainders $a, b, c$ respectively is:
$$\mathbf{\operatorname{HCF}(x - a, \, y - b, \, z - c)}$$

#### Rule 3: Greatest Divisor Leaving Same Remainder $R$ (Unknown)
The greatest number that divides $x, y, z$ leaving the *same* remainder in each case is:
$$\mathbf{\operatorname{HCF}(|x - y|, \, |y - z|, \, |z - x|)}$$
Another way of saying that find the GCD of ^^^^^
Because if two numbers have same remainders when divided by a number then their difference is evenly divided by that number.
