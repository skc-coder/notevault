# Time and Distance

## Theory, Intuition & Formulas

Time and distance problems deal with measuring rate of motion, relative speeds, crossing times for moving objects, and fluid flow dynamics.

### Core Axioms & Invariants

1. **Fundamental Motion Relation**:
   - Speed $S$, Distance $D$, and Time $T$ are linked by:
     $$S = \frac{D}{T} \iff D = S \cdot T \iff T = \frac{D}{S}$$

2. **Unit Conversion Constant**:
   - To convert $\text{km/h}$ to $\text{m/s}$: Multiply by $\frac{5}{18}$
   - To convert $\text{m/s}$ to $\text{km/h}$: Multiply by $\frac{18}{5}$

3. **Average Speed & Harmonic Mean**:
   - For general journeys: $S_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}$
   - For two equal distance segments covered at speeds $x$ and $y$:
     $$S_{\text{avg}} = \frac{2xy}{x + y}$$
   - For three equal distance segments covered at speeds $x, y, z$:
     $$S_{\text{avg}} = \frac{3xyz}{xy + yz + zx}$$

4. **Relative Speed Principle**:
   - Moving in **opposite directions**: $S_{\text{rel}} = x + y$
   - Moving in **same direction**: $S_{\text{rel}} = |x - y|$

5. **Train Crossing Invariants**:
   - Distance covered crossing a point object (pole, standing man): $D = L_{\text{train}}$
   - Distance covered crossing an extended object (platform, bridge, tunnel, another train): $D = L_{\text{train}} + L_{\text{object}}$
   - Post-crossing time ratio theorem: $\frac{S_1}{S_2} = \sqrt{\frac{t_2}{t_1}}$

6. **Boats and Streams Mechanics**:
   - Downstream Speed: $S_d = u + v$
   - Upstream Speed: $S_u = u - v$
   - Boat in Still Water: $u = \frac{S_d + S_u}{2}$
   - Stream Velocity: $v = \frac{S_d - S_u}{2}$
